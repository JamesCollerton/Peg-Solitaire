We've now completed the marking for Conway.

The marking process was similar to last time :

Rob went through the assignments flagging any particular
difficulties or issues. I then marked everyone's assignment
giving a `rough' grade.

I then compared work with the same grade, making sure it was in
fact of a similar standard and re-ranked them.

I then did some sanity checking on the average mark across the cohort etc.

Apologies for the delay with this; my part of it has taken
an enourmously long time due to my bad back & my inability to
sit at a desk for any length of time ...


General Comments (Neill) :

Many of the comments are the same as for the previous assignment :-(

However, this was generally of a higher standard. The extensions were
various, and generally interesting. Remember to always cite the source
of your code if you use someone else's code (e.g. skiplists) not just
the Wikipedia article !
The code quality has improved too, but there were still some silly
mistakes e.g. not testing on lab machines etc.
It's been an enjoyable project to mark.
